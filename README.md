# UCLA-MFE
This repository contains codes used for the UCLA MFE 2020 coursework. All materials and homework problems are solely owned by the UCLA MFE department. All the codes used for the homeworks and projects are written by me for the sole purpose of documentation. All the codes are written in R with some project write-ups written in Rmd. Plagiarism in any form is a violation of the UCLA Student Conduct Code. All class assignments are expected to be original work submitted by individual students; or, if directed by the instructor, by students working in a team.
